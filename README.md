# TO DO LIST

Fix the screen blit (main menu, turn it into a regular white screen again)

font.render (make underscores, then I can just write the missing letters on top of them without having to do a lot of work)

Fix that once you pressed a letter you dont have to press it again or get it wrong because you pressed it again
